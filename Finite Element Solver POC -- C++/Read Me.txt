This Finite Element Solver is a basic proof of concept. It solves a finite elements problem when a mesh is already existent and the data is known/in a certain format.

It is not a finished product. Were I to finish it, I would encapsulate the mesh functions in a mesh class, encapsulate the data points in a data structure, and create a solver class that utilizes the data and mesh. Then I would hook it into an OpenGL canvas with basic 3d modeling abilities, and allow the user to simulate directly from model after specifying a source plane.
